# MyPortfolio
## This is My Portfolio Website !

This portfolio website serves as a practical project to hone my technical skills in web development. It allowed me to apply and deepen my understanding of modern tools and technologies such as React JS, Tailwind CSS, GSAP, and Lenis, while also gaining experience in deploying and managing live projects using Netlify.

Specifically:

* Tailwind CSS: I learned to efficiently style components using Tailwind's utility classes, which speeds up the design process and allows for responsive, visually consistent layouts.

* GSAP for Animations: I explored GSAPâ€™s scroll-triggered animations, learning to make elements reveal smoothly as users scroll. This makes the portfolio more interactive and engaging.

* Lenis for Smooth Scrolling: I integrated Lenis to create a seamless scrolling experience, which improves user engagement and adds a polished feel to the website.

* Best Practices: Throughout, I applied best practices for React development, including structured components and organized layouts to ensure the project is functional and visually appealing across devices.

This project deepened my understanding of building interactive, professional web applications with React and modern frontend tools, making it easier to design and implement highly responsive, user-friendly interfaces.
