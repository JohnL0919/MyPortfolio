# MyPortfolio
## This is My Portfolio Website !

This portfolio website serves as a practical project to hone my technical skills in web development. It allowed me to apply and deepen my understanding of modern tools and technologies such as React JS, Tailwind CSS, GSAP, and Lenis, while also gaining experience in deploying and managing live projects using Netlify.

Specifically:

* React for Frontend Development: I used React to build the website’s user interface, taking advantage of its component-based architecture and state management capabilities to create a dynamic, reusable, and maintainable codebase.
  
* Vite for Development: I leveraged Vite as the build tool and development server for the project, benefiting from its fast cold-start times and efficient hot module replacement (HMR). This streamlined the development process and significantly improved productivity.

* Tailwind CSS: I learned to efficiently style components using Tailwind's utility classes, which speeds up the design process and allows for responsive, visually consistent layouts.

* GSAP for Animations: I explored GSAP’s scroll-triggered animations, learning to make elements reveal smoothly as users scroll. This makes the portfolio more interactive and engaging.

* Lenis for Smooth Scrolling: I integrated Lenis to create a seamless scrolling experience, which improves user engagement and adds a polished feel to the website.

* Netlify for Deployment: I utilized Netlify to deploy the portfolio, streamlining the process with its continuous integration and automatic build features. This ensured reliable hosting, fast performance, and a hassle-free deployment workflow.

This project deepened my understanding of building interactive, professional web applications with React and modern frontend tools, making it easier to design and implement highly responsive, user-friendly interfaces.
